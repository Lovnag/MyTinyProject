# MyTinyProject
Here we go again

The main plan:
1)describing very small integrally whole objects with a simple shape(triangle, sphere) and properties of mass, linear and angular velocities, applied force and position; 
2)describing collisions between them;
3)describing "glue" attaching them to each other, with the possibility of detacching happening if too much force is applied;
4)creating a way to flexibly split a complex body into smaller objects, interactions between which were already created on the previous steps;
5)visualization;
6)polishing, adding more ways of interaction between the small objects.

And here is the alternative plan:
1)light beams as vectors;
2)matrixes for different optical objects:
 a)transmissive optical devices that use refraction(lenses, etc.);
 b)specular reflection devices(mirrors);
3)matrix multipication;
4)realizing optical devices as a sum of objects(needs further research to see if needed);
5)self-focusing;
5)visualization(...);
6)poilshing, adding different quirky things if possible.
