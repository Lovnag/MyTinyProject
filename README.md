# MyTinyProject
Here we go again

So, here is the plan:
1)light beams as vectors;
2)matrixes for different optical objects:
 a)transmissive optical devices that use refraction(lenses, etc.);
 b)specular reflection devices(mirrors);
3)matrix multipication;
4)realizing optical devices as a sum of objects(needs further research to see if needed);
5)self-focusing;
5)visualization(...);
6)poilshing, adding different quirky things if possible;
7)finish.
